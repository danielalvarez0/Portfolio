Name: Daniel Alvarez
Time Invested: too much (5+ hours)

In this project I created a class that used recursion to repeatedly create and 
draw triangles in order to display a Sierpinski fractal. This project was fairly easy 
for me outline. I knew what I wanted to code to be doing and the recursion aspect
 was not difficult. The parts of this assignment I had the most trouble with were
 implementing draw() so my class could extend sf::Drawable and creating the makefile.
 Writing the code for draw went fine, but getting the function declaration
 written and formatted correctly took a great deal of trial and error (minor typos are 
the bane of my draw function's existence). The makefile was difficult because it has been 
almost a year since I have done anything with makefiles and I still rusty.

The second fractal was much easier and I did not encounter any major difficulties while implementing it. I chose a sierpinski carpet as the fractal pattern I would implement.
